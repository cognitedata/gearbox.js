# Asset Scanner

<!-- STORY -->

#### Description:

Using for recognising assets name strings from photo.

#### Usage requirements:

Component depends on few third-part APIs, which is provided by Google
Vision (to recognize text on picture). The user has to insert props
to the component with a valid API key for Google Vision. Follow this
guide to generate an api-key:

**Google Vision API**

> Before you can use the Cloud Vision API, you must enable it for your project and generate your API key, see here how – [Enable the Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/before-you-begin).   

> Don't forget for setting up API key restrictions – [Using API Keys](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys).  

Google Vision API key could be pass to component via **ocrKey** prop or you can passURL address via **ocrUrl** prop in case of own backend realisation of Google Vision API call.  


#### Usage:

```typescript jsx
import 'antd/dist/antd.css';

import React from 'react';
import { AssetScanner } from '@cognite/gearbox';

function ExampleComponent(props) {
  const onUnauthorized = (error: any): void => {};
  return (
    <AssetScanner
      onUnauthorized={onUnauthorized}
      ocrKey={'YOUR_GOOGLE_VISION_KEY'}
    />
