Gearbox is a library of React.JS components for building web applications on top of the Cognite Data Fusion platform.

</div>

It is entirely possible to build the service layer of your [Cognite Data Fusion](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/) powered web app by
making direct HTTP calls to the [Cognite API](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/) endpoints. But you don't have to:
because, instead of HTTP calls, you can call the typed methods on the
[CogniteClient](https://cognitedata.github.io/cognite-sdk-js/classes/cogniteclient.html) class from the
[JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/cognitedata/cognite-sdk-js).

Similarly, it is entirely possible to build the view layer from scratch. But you don't have to, because Gearbox gives
you a set of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) components to handle the most common use cases.

For example, to view all info on an asset given its ID, you just: `<AssetMeta assetId={420042000042042} />`.

Doing an `<AssetTree />` gives you a hierarchical view of all your assets.
Now if you also take the `AssetSearch` component out of the gearbox, what you have are the basic building blocks of
your app's navigation user experience.

`Model3DViewer` component lets you build user interfaces around navigating a 3D model of your assets,
while the `TimeseriesChart` allows visualizing and interacting with the timeseries data streaming out of your assets.

There are many more components in Cognite Gearbox for you to pick and choose from. Continue reading to find out all about them.
